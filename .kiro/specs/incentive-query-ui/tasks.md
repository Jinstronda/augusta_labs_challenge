# Implementation Plan

## Current Status

**BACKEND: âœ… COMPLETE** - All backend services, API endpoints, error handling, and tests are implemented.

**FRONTEND: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS** - Project structure is set up, but all components need to be built.

**REMAINING WORK**: Frontend components (tasks 9-18), deployment config (task 20), documentation (task 21), and E2E testing (task 22).

---

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CONTEXT ðŸš¨**: This is NOT a standalone project. We are building a query UI ON TOP of an existing incentive-company matching system.

**BEFORE EVERY SINGLE TASK**:
1. **READ THE WHOLE PROJECT FIRST** - Read all .md files (README.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, EQUATION.md, UI.md)
2. **READ THE RELEVANT CODE** - Read the existing Python files, backend code, and database schemas
3. **UNDERSTAND WHAT EXISTS** - 250K companies in PostgreSQL + Qdrant, 362 processed incentives, reverse index, scoring system
4. **DO NOT MODIFY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY** - Only add the new UI layer, don't change the core system
5. **INTEGRATE CLEANLY** - Your code should work with what's already there, not replace it

**IMPORTANT**: Always activate the conda environment before running any Python code:
```bash
conda activate turing0.1
```
