The UI queying is going to work like this
Every company is going to have a list of the incentives its connected to (which means its on the top 5 for that incentive)
When we pass a query its gonna go through a first LLM thats gonna anwser us if we are querying for INCENTIVES or querying for companies.
If we are querying for incentives it will find the incentive, return its information. Plus the top 5 companies for it
If we are querying companies its gonna tell us what incentives the company is most suitable for ranked.
It should be a VERY clear ui very similar to chatgpt
