2. **No Retry Button:** Error state doesn't include retry functionality
3. **No Result Filtering:** No client-side filtering of results
4. **No Result Sorting:** Results shown in order received from API

### Future Enhancements
1. Add pagination for multiple results
2. Add retry button in error state
3. Add client-side filtering options
4. Add sorting options
5. Add result comparison feature
6. Add export functionality
7. Add smooth animations between states
