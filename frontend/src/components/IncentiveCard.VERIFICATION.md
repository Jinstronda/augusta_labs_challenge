## Technical Implementation Details

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface IncentiveCardProps {
  incentive: IncentiveResult;
  onCompanyClick?: (companyId: number) => void;
}
```

### Helper Functions
1. `getScoreColor(score)` - Returns TailwindCSS color class based on score
2. `getScoreLabel(score)` - Returns human-readable score interpretation
3. `getRankBadgeColor(rank)` - Returns badge color (gold/silver/bronze/blue)

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (h2, h3, h4)
- Alt text for icons (SVG with descriptive paths)
- Keyboard navigation support (clickable divs)
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards

### Performance
- No unnecessary re-renders (pure functional component)
- Efficient map operations
- No heavy computations in render
- Conditional rendering for optional fields

## Integration Points

### Expected Parent Usage
```typescript
import { IncentiveCard } from './components/IncentiveCard';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ResultsDisplay() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  
  const handleCompanyClick = (companyId: number) => {
    navigate(`/company/${companyId}`);
  };
  
  return (
    <IncentiveCard 
      incentive={incentiveData} 
      onCompanyClick={handleCompanyClick}
    />
  );
}
```

### Data Flow
1. Parent fetches IncentiveResult from API
2. Passes data to IncentiveCard component
3. User clicks company card
4. onCompanyClick callback fires with companyId
5. Parent handles navigation to company detail page

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Render demo component to verify visual appearance
2. Click company cards to verify onClick handler
3. Test with different score ranges (0.0 to 1.0)
4. Test with missing optional fields (website, location, activities)
5. Test responsive layout on mobile/tablet/desktop
6. Verify hover effects work correctly
7. Test website links open in new tab

### Unit Testing (Future)
```typescript
describe('IncentiveCard', () => {
  it('renders incentive title and metadata', () => {});
  it('displays top 5 companies with rank badges', () => {});
  it('calls onCompanyClick when card is clicked', () => {});
  it('shows correct score colors', () => {});
  it('handles missing optional fields gracefully', () => {});
  it('renders empty state when no companies', () => {});
});
```
