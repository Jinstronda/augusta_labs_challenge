## Integration Example

```typescript
import { IncentiveCard } from './components/IncentiveCard';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  
  return (
    <IncentiveCard 
      incentive={incentiveData}
      onCompanyClick={(id) => navigate(`/company/${id}`)}
    />
  );
}
```

## Scoring System (from EQUATION.md)

**Formula**: `FINAL SCORE = 0.50S + 0.20M + 0.10G + 0.15O′ + 0.05W`

- **S** (0.50): Semantic similarity
- **M** (0.20): CAE/Activity overlap
- **G** (0.10): Geographic fit
- **O′** (0.15): Organizational capacity
- **W** (0.05): Website presence

## Next Steps

1. **Test the demo**: Import `IncentiveCardDemo` in App.tsx to see it in action
2. **Integrate with API**: Connect to the `/api/query` endpoint
3. **Add routing**: Implement navigation to company detail pages
4. **Write tests**: Add unit tests for component behavior
